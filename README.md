## Project Summary

First project for FlatIron School's Software Engineering program. Goal was to create an SPA using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript & fetch data from an external API.

Users can select two currencies and enter the amount of the first currency. After entering an amount, the exchange rate for the desired currency will be reflected in the second currency and show the exchange rate at this given moment. 

## Notice
THIS CODE WORKS ON A FREE API KEY, WHICH WORKS ON UNDER 200 CALLS/MONTH. THE PROJECT CAN BE MODIFIED WITH A BETTER API TO ENHANCE ACCURACY + MAX CALL AMOUNT
